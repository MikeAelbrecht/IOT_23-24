> - PIR sensor connected to a RP2040.
> - Send data from a RP2040 using a nRF20L01 module to a Rpi when movement is detected by the PIR sensor.
> - Receive the data on the Rpi with another nRF20L01 module.
> - Database entry with a timestamp of the moment the data was received.
> - Web-GUI to see all database entries.
> - Possibilty to send data to the RP2040. (Specific for the project)
